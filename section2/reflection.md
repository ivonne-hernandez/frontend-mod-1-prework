## Section 2 Reflection

#### 1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I feel like it is better to just ask the questions that you have so that you're not spending hours trying to fix something and being frustrated the whole time. **It's a much better use of your time to try to get the correct answer quicker by asking questions.** I did get frustrated recently while trying to figure out how to do a pull request on GitHub but it wasn't until I reached out for help that I was able to find the answer that I was looking for. This taught me that I just need to use the Googling techniques correctly instead of just trying to rush towards an answer. Was it a dumb question? I'm sure it was, but it prevented me from spending hours reading irrelevant information, when all I had to do was ask for help and complete the task in less than 5 minutes. The only downside is that I asked for help too soon. I need to make sure that I'm _**spending at least 20 minutes trying to resolve the issue by myself instead of asking for help to just get it over with**_. I really like that the article suggested having people on a team estimate how much time a task should take so that you're setting do-able goals for everyone. This also encourages collaboration when someone gets stuck because they don't want to fall too behind on their deadline. **Overall, asking questions will positively impact and accelerate my growth.**

It's going to take some time to find that balance between googling and pushing yourself to solve a problem without hand-holding, and reaching out for help. That's ok! be patient with yourself. The way you will find that balance is by being cognizant and aware of how you currently operate. Keep this on your mind as you work through this section, and... there is no time like the present to start asking questions!

#### 2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

I felt pretty competent running a file in node and learning about functions and other concepts by exploring outside resources. There wasn't anything uncomfortable about it because it allowed me to venture out on my own to figure things out. I think this supported my learning by encouraging me to use the skills and knowledge that I already have to learn new things.

#### 3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A _**conditional statement**_ is based on a concept of _if/then/else_. `If` a condition is met, then your code executes one or more statements, otherwise (`else`) your code does something different (or just skips the step). In a nutshell, _conditional statements control conditional instructions_. An example of a daily life conditional could be if you have food, you can eat, otherwise you can't. An example of where a conditional is probably used is when I try to view my account on the Wells Fargo website. If I'm logged in, I can view my account, else I can't.

#### 4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how the program reads them and determines what to do.

You add multiple conditions to an `if` statement by using subsequent `else if` or `else` statements.  The program reads multiple conditions by checking to see if the first condition is true. If the first condition is true, it will run the subsequent code block. If it is not true, then it will check to see if the second condition is true. If the first condition is false and the second condition is true, then it will run the subsequent code block, otherwise it won't. The program continues to run the remaining conditions until it finds one that is true and executes that code block. If none of the conditions are met, then none of the code blocks will execute.


#### 5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

The tool that is available to _**check if two conditions are met**_ is the logical `AND` operator. The tool that is available to _**check that 1 of 2 conditions are met**_ is the logical `OR` operator.

#### 6. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

Why do _**functions**_ not need their _**parameter(s)**_ data types specified or defined? Wouldn't this cause errors to occur if the _**argument(s)**_ were the incorrect data type?
