## Section 3 Reflection

##### 1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
The two points that resonated with me from the Growth Mindset article were to **focus on the process** and to **understand that making mistakes are essential to learning.**

##### 2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset by not being afraid to seek help when I really need it. I also know that the only way that I can improve my coding skills is by putting in the effort to practice every day. The ways in which I don't currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset is not believing at times that making mistakes are essential to learning and that seeking out challenges will only help me improve my skills.

##### 3. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
A mobile application that probably uses Arrays is KeePass. It is a password manager that stores the users usernames and passwords for specified websites. I think they probably use arrays since they have the list of passwords and usernames that you've saved on your account.

##### 4. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
An **array method** is a function you can call in order to manipulate the data within the array.

##### 5. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
The purpose of a **loop** is to execute an action until the condition is no longer `true`. Loops help us write the code for that action one time, but instructs our program to carry it out until the condition is no longer true.

We would use a loop in conjunction with an **array** when we want to run the same code/action for each item in the array. We would use a loop without an array when you want to repeat an action.

##### 6. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
A loop is used for when you want to tell the computer what to do, and you want the computer to repeat those instructions until you tell it to stop.



##### 7. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
In regards to `for` loops, do we always have to use the `var` keyword when declaring the i variable? If so, why? Why does it work without the var keyword?
