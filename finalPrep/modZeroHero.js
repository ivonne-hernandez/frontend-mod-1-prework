// Challenge - See if you can follow the instructions and complete the exercise in under 30 minutes!

// Declare two variables - heroName AND specialAbility - set to strings
var heroName = "Dash";
var specialAbility = "speed";

// Declare two variables - greeting AND catchphrase
//   greeting should be assigned to a string that uses concatenation to include the heroName
//   catchphrase should be assigned to a string that uses interpolation to include the specialAbility
var greeting = "Hello " + heroName;
var catchphrase = "Can't catch up to my ${specialAbility}";

// Declare two variables - power AND energy - set to integers
var power = 10;
var energy = 1000;

// Declare two variables - fullPower AND fullEnergy
//   fullPower should multiply your current power by 500
//   fullEnergy should add 150 to your current energy
var fullPower = power * 500;
var fullEnergy = energy + 150;

// Declare two variables - isHuman and identityConcealed - assigned to booleans
var isHuman = true;
var identityConcealed = true;

// Declare two variables - archEnemies AND sidekicks
//   archEnemies should be an array of at least 3 different enemy strings
//   sidekicks should be an array of at least 3 different sidekick strings
var archEnemies = ["Thanos", "Lightning Bolt", "Usain Bolt"];
var sidekicks = ["Aquaman", "Wonderwoman", "Batman"];

// Print the first sidekick to your console
console.log(sidekicks[0]);
// Print the last archEnemy to the console
console.log(archEnemies[2]);
// Write some code to add a new archEnemy to the archEnemies array
archEnemies.push("Bolt");
// Print the archEnemies array to console to ensure you added a new archEnemy
console.log(archEnemies);
// Remove the first sidekick from the sidekicks array
sidekicks.shift();
// Print the sidekicks array to console to ensure you added a new sidekick
console.log(sidekicks);

// Create a function called assessSituation that takes three arguments - dangerLevel, saveTheDay, badExcuse
//   - dangerLevel should be an integer
//   - saveTheDay should be a string a hero would say once they save the day
//   - badExcuse should be a string a hero would say if they are too afraid of the dangerLevel
function assessSituation(dangerLevel, saveTheDay, badExcuse) {
  if (dangerLevel > 50) {
    console.log(badExcuse);
  } else if (dangerLevel >= 10 && dangerLevel <=50) {
    console.log(saveTheDay);
  } else if (dangerLevel < 10) {
    console.log("Meh. Hard pass.");
  }
}
assessSituation(7878, "I have outdone myself yet again!", "You know, I think I may sit this one out.");
assessSituation(50, "I have outdone myself yet again!", "You know, I think I may sit this one out.");
assessSituation(5, "I have outdone myself yet again!", "You know, I think I may sit this one out.");

// Your function should include an if/else statement that meets the following criteria
//   - Danger levels that are above 50 are too scary for your hero. Any danger level that is above 50 should result in printing the badExcuse to the console
//   - Anything dangerLevel that is between 10 and 50 should result in printing the saveTheDay string to the console
//   - If the dangerLevel is below 10, it means it is not worth your time and should result in printing the string "Meh. Hard pass." to the console.

//Test Cases
var announcement = 'Never fear, the Courageous Curly Bracket is here!';
var excuse = 'I think I forgot to lock up my 1992 Toyota Coralla. Be right back.';
assessSituation(99, announcement, excuse);
// > Should print - 'I think I forgot to lock up my 1992 Toyota Coralla. Be right back.'

assessSituation(21, announcement, excuse);
 // > should print - 'Never fear, the Courageous Curly Bracket is here!'

assessSituation(3, announcement, excuse)
// > should print - "Meh. Hard pass."

// Declare a new variable - scaryMonster - assigned to an Object with the following key/values
//   - name (string)
//   - smell (string)
//   - weight (integer)
//   - citiesDestroyed (array)
//   - luckyNumbers (array)
//   - address (object with following key/values: number , street , state, zip) (need to work on this!)

// Create a new class called SuperHero
// - Your class should have the following DYNAMIC values
//   - name
//   - superpower
//   - age
// - Your class should have the following STATIC values
//   - archNemesis, assigned to "The Syntax Error"
//   - powerLevel = 100

// - Create the following class methods
//   - sayName, should print the hero's name to the console
//   - maximizeEnergy, should update the energyLevel to 1000
//   - gainPower, should take an argument of a number and INCREASE the powerLevel by that number

// - Create 2 instances of your SuperHero class


// Reflection
// What parts were most difficult about this exerise?
// The most difficult parts were creating a function, an object, an object within an object and a class.
// What parts felt most comfortable to you?
// Declaring variables of all types.
// What skills do you need to continue to practice before starting Mod 1?
// Creating a function, an object, an object within an object and a class. I really need to brush up on my definitions and syntax for each of these items so that I'm able to complete these exercises a lot quicker.
