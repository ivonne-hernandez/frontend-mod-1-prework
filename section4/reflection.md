## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
My workflow felt much more focused and intentional this week as a result of using the Pomodoro technique.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
Regarding the work I did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique, I think it went much better than I thought it would. Deciding on the tasks that I needed to get done helped me adhere to the workflow and stay focused. I also intentionally left my phone in the other room so that I wouldn't be tempted to distract myself from the tasks at hand. In regards to timing, I'm still going to have to work on that because I was a bit off.

3. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

An **object** is a way to store more complex data with _key-value pairs_. Objects store data but instead of using only index positions to get the data like you would for an Array, you can use keys which are represented with strings.

4. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  An array would be better because this is a list of the same thing, students.

  * List of states and their capitals
  An object would be better because you can have the keys be the names of the states and their values would be their capitols. Objects store key-value pairs.

  * List of things to pack for vacation
  An array would be better because this is a list of all of the items that you're taking to the related vacation.

  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  An array would be better because this is a list of all of the related Instagram accounts that you follow.

  * List of student names and their cohort
  An object would be better because you can have the keys be the names of the students and their values would be their cohort.

  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  An object would be better because you can have the keys be the ingredients and their values would be the amount of each ingredient.

  * All my favorite restaurants
  An array would be better because this is a list of all of my related favorite restaurants.

5. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties that a bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
A tweet on Twitter. The keys that might be on it are number of likes, author, body of the tweet, and the date it was posted. Some sample values could be 12134 number of likes, "Sammy" as the author, "hello world" as the body of the tweet and "7/19/21" as the date that it was posted.

6. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
Why are classes technically a type of function in Javascript? Is this true outside of Javascript? Are there any downsides to having this type of functionality? How does the `this` keyword work?
