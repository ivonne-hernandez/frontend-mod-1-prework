## Section 1 Reflection

**1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?**

I already take care of my brain by trying to eat healthy and staying active. I also started reading more books this year. I think I'll try to view _learning as a process and not a destination_ which goes hand in hand with having a growth mindset. I'll also try helping others if I know what I'm doing.

**2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.**

The data types that I learned about in this section include *strings*, *numbers* and *booleans*.
* A _**string**_ data type consists of letters and other characters, all wrapped up within quotes (either single or double).
* A _**number**_ data type consists of all numbers, including negatives and decimals (i.e. floating); large numbers are written without commas.
* A _**boolean**_ data type evaluates to one of two values either true or false; it is helpful when trying to determine which script should run.

**3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?**

`console.log("Hello World!");`

**4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?**

The characters I would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file are:
 * `// for single line comments` or
 * ```/* for multi-line comments */```

The purpose of a code comment is to allow us to add information for other developers in our code. It also allows us to de-activate parts of the code from running.

**5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?**

A _**variable**_ is something that allows us to store a value and reuse the value in multiple places. It's like a box with a label. The label is the name of the variable and what is inside the box is the value of the variable.

**6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?**

I use the Tiktok app frequently. Three variables that are probably used include the following:

```javascript
var comment = "comment";
var heart = "true";
var numberOfLikes = 12012;
```

The comment variable would probably hold a string data type. The heart variable would probably hold a boolean data type.The numberOfLikes variable would probably hold a number data type.

**7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.**

_**Concatenation**_ is when you join strings together using the _**+ operator**_.

**8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?**

I think developers use concatenation in the Gmail Inbox because previews of emails concatenate the subject line with the body to give you a quick idea of what the email is about.

**9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)**

Are we supposed to be completing this pre-work within the estimated time allotments? In other words, if we're taking a little bit longer than what is estimated, is that going to be a problem once we start Mod 1? Is there anyway that we can have longer Mod 0 sessions? Are we supposed to be formatting our reflections? Since the Markdown cheatsheet was linked, I assumed that was the case. What is the difference between gists and repositories? It seems like gists just contain text and repositories contain directories and files. Are they linked to each other?
